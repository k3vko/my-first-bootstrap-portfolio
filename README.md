## About This Project

This portfolio marks my initial step into the world of web development, focusing on the application of Bootstrap. It serves as a practical project to show how to use a frontend framework to speed up development and create responsive designs more efficiently. It still reflects my commitment to writing clean and responsive code, but now with the added layer of a framework.

Beyond the technical aspects, this site also offers a personal glimpse into my interests, including my fitness goals and my Serbian Orthodox Christian faith, which are important pillars in my life and influence my disciplined approach to projects.

## Technologies

This project is built with a focus on a solid foundation, now enhanced with Bootstrap:

* **HTML5:** For structuring and semantically marking up the content.
* **CSS3:** For customized styling beyond Bootstrap's defaults.
* **Bootstrap 5:** The core framework for all layouts, components, and responsive adaptations.

## Features

* **Responsive Design:** Adapts gracefully to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) through Bootstrap's powerful grid system.
* **Bootstrap Components:** Utilizes components like the navigation bar, cards, and forms to create a modern and consistent user interface.
* **Interactive Contact Form:** A straightforward way to get in touch with me.
* **Placeholder Projects Section:** A dedicated area for showcasing future works.
* **Personal "About Me" Section:** A brief introduction to myself and my interests.
